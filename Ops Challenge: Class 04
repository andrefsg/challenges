#Hello world (prints “Hello world!” to the screen)

#IP info (print the network adapter information for this computer)

#Next, the user input should be requested.
#The program should next use a conditional statement to evaluate the user’s input, then act according to what the user selected.
#Use a loop to bring up the menu again after the request has been executed.
